# The xPack OpenOCD

> **Note**: If you are looking for how to build Nuclei OpenOCD, please check [README-BUILD-Nuclei.md](README-BUILD-Nuclei.md)

This open source project is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack) 
and provides the platform specific binaries for the
[xPack OpenOCD](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/). 

This distribution follows the official [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org).

The binaries can be installed automatically as **binary xPacks** or manually as
**portable archives**.

In addition to the package meta data, this project also includes
the build scripts.

## User info

This section is intended as a shortcut for those who plan 
to use the OpenOCD binaries. For full details please read the 
[xPack OpenOCD](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/) pages.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install OpenOCD is using the **binary xPack**, available as 
[`@xpack-dev-tools/openocd`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

#### Prerequisites

The only requirement is a recent 
`xpm`, which is a portable 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line application. To install it,
follow the instructions from the 
[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

#### Install

With the `xpm` tool available, installing 
the latest version of the package is quite easy:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd@latest
```

This command will always install the latest available version, 
into the central xPacks repository, which is a platform dependent folder 
(check the output of the `xpm` command or the actual folder used on 
your platform).

This location is configurable using the environment variable 
`XPACKS_REPO_FOLDER`; for more details please check the 
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

xPacks aware tools, like the **GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins** automatically 
identify binaries installed with
`xpm` and provide a convenient method to manage paths.

#### Uninstall

To remove the installed xPack, the command is similar:

```console
$ xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/openocd
```

(Note: not yet implemented. As a temporary workaround, simply remove the 
`xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/openocd` folder, or one of the the versioned 
subfolders.)

### Manual install

For all platforms, the **xPack OpenOCD** binaries are released as portable 
archives that can be installed in any location.

The archives can be downloaded from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases/)
page.

For more details please read the 
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/install/) page. 

### Windows drivers

Most JTAG probes require separate drivers on Windows. 
For more details please read the 
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/install/) page.

### GNU/Linux UDEV subsystem

For the JTAG probes implemented as USB devices (actually most of them), 
the last installation step on GNU/Linux is to configure the UDEV subsystem. 

For more details please read the 
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/install/) page.
